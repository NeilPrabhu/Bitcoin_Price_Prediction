# bitcoin_price_prediction
A Final Group Project completed in course W207 "Applied Machine Learning" at UC Berkeley's MIDS program.

The goal was to predict bitcoin price movement using classificaiton (0 no change/decrease in BTC and 1 rise in BTC) and regression (by how much did BTC increase).

The code was done via python on Jupyter Notebooks.
